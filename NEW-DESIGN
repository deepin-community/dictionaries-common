[ Convention: IDWP = "ispell dictionary or wordlist package" ]

Dependencies
============

Every IDWP has to declare 

    Pre-Depends: dictionaries-common

in its debian/control.  The reason for that is because the config script
must call a script contained in the dictionaries-common package.  Hence,
when the IDWP is going to be configured, dictionaries-common must be
already installed and fully configured.

Every IDWP has also to declare 

    Build-Depends: dictionaries-common-dev

to make autobuilders and debuild happy.


/var/lib/dictionaries-common/(ispell|wordlist)/<package-name>
=============================================================

This file must be installed by the package and have the following format
(reminiscent of the RFC 822 format):

    Language: portuguÍs brasileiro (Brazilian Portuguese) 
    Hash-Name: brazilian
    Emacsen-Name: brasileiro
    Casechars: [a-z·ÈÌÛ˙‡ËÏÚ˘„ıÁ¸‚ÍÙA-Z¡…Õ”⁄¿»Ã“Ÿ√’«‹¬ ‘]
    Not-Casechars: [^a-z·ÈÌÛ˙‡ËÏÚ˘„ıÁ¸‚ÍÙA-Z¡…Õ”⁄¿»Ã“Ÿ√’«‹¬ ‘]
    Otherchars: [---']
    Many-Otherchars: yes
    Additionalchars: ·ÈÌÛ˙‡ËÏÚ˘„ıÁ¸‚ÍÙ¡…Õ”⁄¿»Ã“Ÿ√’«‹¬ ‘
    Ispell-Args: 
    Extended-Character-Mode: 
    Coding-System: iso-8859-1

Each field in this file must be contained in a single line.  They may also
have the right side (i.e., after the character ":") empty, which is
equivalent to suppressing the field (the default value will be used in this
case, see below).

Several records as the above may be present in each file and must be
separated by a blank line.  They must have unique values for the Language
field.

The records supplied by each dictionary package will be used by the core of
dictionaries-common to provide site-wide configuration, including
Debconf list of choices, ispell/wordlist default symlinks, automatic
generation of add-on support (emacsen, jed and mutt).  This file is
therefore essential for the correct integration of the dictionary packages
into the dictionaries-common scheme.

Here is an explanation of the fields shown above:

    Language: (this field is mandatory)

      Comprehensive description of the language.  It is advised to include
      both the description in the original language (with the appropriate
      character coding system) and a description in English between
      parentheses.  This will help the system administrators around the
      world, who does not now how the dictionaries are spelled in their
      original language.

      This field will be used in the Debconf list of choices as well as
      a key for determining the language default for the ispell-wrapper
      utility.  Hence, it has to be unique among all the installed
      dictionaries in the system.

    Hash-Name: (this field is mandatory)
  
      Base name of the files that will appear as symlinks in both
      /usr/lib/ispell of /usr/share/dict.  Has to be unique among the
      installed dictionaries in the system.

    Emacsen-Name: (optional, defaults to Hash-Name)

      Entry name of the dictionary that appears in the list of choices of
      the emacsen ispell package.  Maintainers should try to respect the
      tradition of that package, by keeping the name that they used to have
      in the past.

    Casechars: (optional, defaults to [a-zA-Z])

      Emacs-Lisp regular expression of valid characters that comprise a
      word.  It is typically enclodes between square brackets.

    Not-Casechars: (optional, defaults to [^a-zA-Z])

      Opposite regexp of Casechars.

    Otherchars: (optional, defaults to ['])

      Regexp of characters in the Not-Casechars set but which can be
      used to construct words in some special way. (See the ispell.el
      documentation for details.)

    Many-Otherchars: (optional, default value no)

      Boolean variable (assuming either the values yes or no). If it is
      non-nil when multiple Otherchars are allowed in a word.  Otherwise
      only a single Otherchars character is allowed to be part of any
      single word. 

    Additionalchars: (optional, defaults to an empty string)

      Characters other than ASCII that may be part of a word.  This is
      somehow redundant with the Casechars field, but is necessary for the
      proper working of the -w option to ispell.

    Ispell-Args: (optional, defaults to -d <Hash-Name>)

      List of additional arguments passed to the ispell.

    Extended-Character-Mode: (optional, defaults to the empty string)

      Set when dictionaries are used which have been configured in an
      ispell affix file.  (For example, umlauts can be encoded as \\\"a,
      a\\\", \"a, ...) 

    Coding-System : (optional, defaults to the empty string)
    
      Used for languages with multibyte characters.


Debconf
=======

Each IDWP must have the following debian/templates file:

    Template: shared/packages-(ispell|wordlist)
    Type: text
    Description:

    Template: #PACKAGE#/languages
    Type: text
    Default: #LANGUAGES#
    Description:

The token #PACKAGE# must be replaced by *exactly* the name of the package
and #LANGUAGES# must be replaced by a comma separated list of languages
provided by the package.  The entries in the #LANGUAGES# substitution must
be *exactly* the same that appear in the file
/var/lib/dictionaries-common/(idict|wordlist)/<package-name>.

Additional templates may be added, if needed.

The debian/config script must contain exactly the Perl code below:

    use Debconf::Client::ConfModule q(:all);

    version ('2.0');

    my $class = "[I:ispell:][W:wordlist:]";
    my $question = "shared/packages-$class";

    my @choices = ();
    map {
      push (@choices, split (/\s*,\s*/, metaget ("$_/languages", "default")));
    } sort split (/\s*,\s*/, metaget ($question, "owners"));
    my $choices = join (', ', @choices);

    $question = "dictionaries-common/default-$class";
    if ($choices ne metaget ($question, "choices")) {
      subst ($question, "choices", $choices);
      fset ($question, "isdefault", "true");
      input ("critical", $question);
      title ("[I:Ispell dictionary:][W:Wordlist dictionary:]");
      go ();
    }

If some other debconf actions need to be added and they are in Perl, just
add them to the script above.  If you prefer to write in shell, wrap the
script above in the following shell code:

    tmp=`tempfile`
    cat > $tmp <<EOF
    # (the script above)
    EOF
    perl $tmp
    rm -f $tmp


Maintainer scripts
==================

Each IDWP postint script must include the following code:

    . /usr/share/debconf/confmodule
    if [ "$1" = "configure" ] ; then 
      /usr/sbin/update-default-(ispell|wordlist) --rebuild
    fi

Each IDWP postrm script must include the following code:

    case "$1" in remove|deconfigure)
      /usr/sbin/remove-default-(ispell|wordlist) <package-name>
      if [ -e /usr/share/debconf/confmodule ] ; then
        . /usr/share/debconf/confmodule
        db_purge
      fi
    esac


Ispell wrapper
==============

A ispell wrapper command will be made available by dictionaries common.
This command will accept all the ispell options plus -L <language>, where
language must correspond to one of the languages intalled in the system
(Perl regular expressions will be probably available here, such that
calling ispell-wrapper -L ".*brasil.*" will select "PortuguÍs
Brasileiro").  

An interactive selection script will also be available for selecting the
default ispell dictionary both system-wide (when run by root, placing the
result in /etc/dictionaries-common/default-ispell) or user-specific (placing
the result in ~/.default-ispell).


System wide configuration
=========================

Besides the debconf configuration at installation time, there will be a
/usr/sbin/select-default-(ispell|wordlist) script that will call the
debconf question and will be responsible to set the appropriate links
/usr/lib/(ispell|words)/default.*.


Add-on support
==============

Emacsen, jed and mutt add-on support will be fully auto-generated by the
update-default-(ispell|wordlist) script.  Also, links in /usr/lib/ispell
correponding to the Emacsen-Name: field will be automatically generated.


dictionaries-common internals
=============================

System scripts:

    select-default-(ispell|wordlist):
        Make debconf always ask the shared question. Call
        update-default-(ispell|wordlist). 

    update-default-(ispell|wordlist):
        Read the system default from the debconf database and set links in
        default links in /etc/dictionaries-common pointing to the
        appropriate files in /usr/lib/ispell or /usr/share/dict.  
        Also updates the system-wide setting
        /etc/dictionaries-common/(ispell|wordlist)-default.  
        If option --rebuild is given, rebuilds the
        /var/cache/dictionaries-common/(ispell|wordlist).db and the emacsen
        and jed support (to be put in
        /var/cache/dictionaries-common/(emacsen|jed)) from the files in
        /var/lib/dictionaries-common/(ispell|wordlist) 

    remove-default-(ispell|wordlist):
        Call update-default-(ispell|wordlist) --rebuild.
