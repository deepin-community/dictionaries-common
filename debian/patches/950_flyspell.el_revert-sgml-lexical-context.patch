Description: Revert (sgml-lexical-context) use in flyspell (bzr#98607 and bzr#98656)
    
Use of (sgml-lexical-context) has some problems:
            
 * It is not available under XEmacs.
 
 * There is some obscure conflict with psgml (probably a psgml problem)
   that sometimes causes errors of the form:
                            
   Error in post-command-hook: (wrong-type-argument stringp nil)
   sgml-lexical-context: Wrong type argument: stringp, nil
                                              
   This happens even in emacs-snapshot when used original code with
   (sgml-lexical-context) together with psgml as preferred sgml mode.
   psgml provides 'sgml-mode, but has no `sgml-lexical-context'
   definition. Either if I manually load 'sgml-mode' or trust autoload
   at some points I sometimes get errors above.
                                                                                
   Function seems loaded since describe-function sgml-lexical-context
   works, and I can even explicitly evaluate it in the buffer (and
   seems to evaluate correctly).
   
* Is way slower than an own dedicated regexp.
