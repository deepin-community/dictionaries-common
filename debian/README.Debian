dictionaries-common and dictionaries-common-dev for Debian
==========================================================

These packages contain the common support structure implementing the policy
proposal for spellchecking dictionaries and wordlists. For more
information please see

 http://dict-common.alioth.debian.org/
 http://alioth.debian.org/projects/dict-common

dictionaries-common
-------------------

This is the basic package. All ispell, aspell and myspell/hunspell
dictionaries must depend on it, as well as all wordlists other than
wamerican (which will use it if available, but will still be
installable otherwise).

It provides the common structure for the use of the system. These are
some commands of interest for the superuser or for normal users
regarding ispell dictionaries and wordlists. For more details or
developers information, please see the dictionaries-common-dev
package.

select-default-ispell:
select-default-wordlist:

    (root only)
    Although at installation time the system administrator has been asked (if
    there is more that one dictionary or wordlist installed in the system)
    which one will be the system default, these commands allow changing the
    default value for ispell dictionary or wordlist at any time.

ispell-wrapper:

    The system provides a wrapper to ispell (named ispell-wrapper) with an
    enhanced command line interface that will take care of passing to ispell
    the appropriate options for a language.

    This command will accept all the ispell options plus -L <language>, where
    language must correspond to one of the languages installed in the system
    (Perl regular expressions will be probably available here, such that
    calling ispell-wrapper -L ".*brasil.*" will select
    "PortuguÃªs Brasileiro").

select-default-iwrap:

    This is an interactive selection script for selecting the user-specific
    default ispell dictionary for ispell-wrapper. The result will be placed
    in ~/.default-ispell.

    The system wide default value for ispell-wrapper will be the globally
    selected one at installation time or through select-default-ispell.

dictionaries-common-dev
-----------------------

This is the package for developers. It contains the complete policy
document, as well as debhelper like support scripts. Use of these is
strongly recommended.

The text of the policy is available at the documentation directory for this
package as dsdt-policy.html or dsdt-policy.txt.gz

Other notes regarding these packages:
=====================================

ispell dicts and wordlists naming and availability
--------------------------------------------------

Note that you will find two types of dictionaries :

 * dictionaries for ispell spellchecker, whose package names are of the
   form i<language>, e.g. iamerican (for ispell)

 * simple alphabetic lists of words, application-independent
   (also known as "wordlists") whose package names are mostly of the form
   w<language>, e.g. wspanish (with the exception of "miscfiles" that
   also provides a wordlist as well as some many other things)

Since ispell dictionaries must provide 'ispell-dictionary' and
wordlists 'wordlist', if you want to know a list of the available ispell
dictionaries or wordlists please try

$ apt-cache search --names-only ispell-dictionary
$ apt-cache search --names-only wordlist

Templates localization:
-----------------------

As of 0.9.5 templates handling has been migrated to po-debconf. It will
store the templates in the preferred encoding and they will be shown in
the user's encoding by means of libtext-iconv-perl if installed. Note
that this sometimes need changing the LANG value from a thing like
'spanish' to something like 'es_ES'. Check if this is your case.
